# Chapter 15: Multi-Node Inference, Parallelism, Decoding, and Routing Optimizations

This chapter covers advanced optimization techniques for efficient, high-performance multi-node inference for massive LLMs, including disaggregated prefill-decode architectures and various parallelism strategies.

## Files Overview

### Core Examples

- **`disaggregated_inference.py`** - Comprehensive demonstration of disaggregated prefill-decode architecture, MoE routing, speculative decoding, and parallelism strategies
- **`requirements.txt`** - Dependencies for multi-node inference examples

## Key Concepts

### Disaggregated Prefill and Decode Architecture

**Traditional Problem: Prefill-Decode Interference**
- Prefill: Large parallel computations processing entire prompts
- Decode: Many small sequential computations for token generation  
- Colocated on same nodes leads to resource contention and suboptimal performance

**Solution: Separate GPU Pools**
- Dedicated prefill workers for prompt processing
- Dedicated decode workers for token generation
- Communication via KV cache transfer using high-bandwidth interconnects

**Benefits:**
- 4x higher goodput (SLO-compliant throughput) 
- 30-50% higher throughput at same p95 latency
- Independent scaling and optimization of each phase
- Eliminates resource "dead time" from cross-phase interference

### Parallelism Strategies for Massive MoE Models

| Strategy | Partition Basis | Use Case | Pros | Cons |
|----------|----------------|----------|------|------|
| **Tensor Parallelism (TP)** | Within layers (split weight matrices) | Single model too large for one GPU | Near-linear speedup, overlapped communication | Frequent all-reduce, requires high-bandwidth interconnect |
| **Pipeline Parallelism (PP)** | Different layers on different GPUs | Extremely deep models | Memory scaling, micro-batching | Pipeline bubbles, increased latency |
| **Expert Parallelism (EP)** | Different MoE experts on different GPUs | Massive MoE models | Unlimited model scaling, sparse compute | High all-to-all communication, load imbalance |
| **Data Parallelism (DP)** | Replicate entire model | Scale throughput | Linear scaling, simple implementation | No latency improvement, multiplied memory |
| **Context Parallelism (CP)** | Partition input sequence across GPUs | Ultra-long sequences (100k+ tokens) | Near-linear speedup for long context | Custom attention algorithms required |

### Advanced Parallelism Combinations

**Hybrid Strategies:**
- **TP + PP**: Split wide layers with TP, deep models with PP
- **TP + EP**: Tensor parallelism within experts, expert parallelism across experts
- **3D Parallelism**: TP + PP + DP for maximum scale
- **4D Parallelism**: TP + PP + EP + DP for MoE models

### MoE Load Balancing and Routing

**Expert Load Balancing:**
- Top-1 vs Top-2 gating trade-offs
- Capacity factor (1.2-1.5x average load) to prevent hot experts
- Dynamic expert replication for load distribution
- Load-balancing losses during training

**Dynamic Routing Optimizations:**
- Expert placement strategies to minimize communication
- Backup expert replicas for hot experts
- Adaptive gating based on real-time load metrics
- Inference-time expert swapping

### Speculative Decoding Techniques

**Draft-and-Verify Schemes:**
- Generate multiple candidate tokens in parallel
- Verify candidates against main model
- Accept correct prefixes, reject and retry incorrect tokens
- Medusa, EAGLE, and other advanced techniques

**Performance Improvements:**
- 2-4x speedup for typical workloads
- Reduced sequential decode bottleneck
- Maintains model quality while improving throughput

### Infrastructure and Communication

**High-Bandwidth Interconnects:**
- **NVLink/NVSwitch**: 1.8 TB/s on Blackwell, optimal for TP
- **InfiniBand/RDMA**: Cross-node communication for PP/EP
- **GPUDirect RDMA**: Zero-copy GPU-to-GPU transfers
- **NIXL Library**: Automatic path selection for optimal transfers

**KV Cache Management:**
- Efficient transfer between prefill and decode workers
- Shared memory segments for zero-copy access
- Compressed and quantized cache representations
- Dynamic cache allocation and cleanup

## Usage Examples

### Running the Comprehensive Example

```bash
# Run the complete multi-node inference benchmark

### Interactive Usage

```python
from disaggregated_inference import (
    DisaggregatedInferenceSystem, 
    MoERouter, 
    SpeculativeDecoder,
    InferenceConfig
)

# Configure multi-node inference
config = InferenceConfig(
    model_size=7_000_000_000,
    num_gpus=8,
    num_experts=8,
    use_speculative=True
)

# Test disaggregated architecture
system = DisaggregatedInferenceSystem(config)
system.setup_prefill_workers()
system.setup_decode_workers()

# Process a request
prompt = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. " * 50
response = system.process_request(prompt)

# Test MoE routing
router = MoERouter(num_experts=8, top_k=2, capacity_factor=1.2)
tokens = list(range(100))
assignments = router.route_tokens(tokens)

# Test speculative decoding
decoder = SpeculativeDecoder()
speculative_tokens = decoder.speculative_decode(prompt, target_tokens=20)
```
