## Implementation Guidelines

### Disaggregated Architecture
1. Separate prefill and decode GPU pools
2. Use high-bandwidth interconnects for KV cache transfer
3. Implement dynamic scaling based on workload characteristics
4. Monitor and optimize communication overhead

### Parallelism Configuration
1. Use tensor parallelism within nodes (NVLink domain)
2. Apply pipeline parallelism minimally for memory scaling
3. Maximize expert parallelism for MoE parameter distribution
4. Add data parallel replicas for throughput scaling
5. Consider context parallelism for ultra-long inputs

### Speculative Decoding
1. Choose draft model with high fidelity to target model
2. Ensure same tokenizer and vocabulary
3. Optimize for 4x+ speed difference between draft and target
4. Monitor acceptance rates and adjust draft model selection

### MoE Routing
1. Use top-2 gating with capacity factors (1.2-1.5x)
2. Implement hierarchical all-to-all communication
3. Monitor per-expert utilization and response latency
4. Replicate hot experts to avoid bottlenecks
5. Use adaptive routing for dynamic load balancing

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **High Communication Overhead**: Optimize all-to-all patterns and use hierarchical routing
- **Load Imbalance**: Implement capacity factors and expert replication
- **Low Speculative Acceptance**: Tune draft model selection and temperature
