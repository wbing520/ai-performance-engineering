    "We use [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to manage our environment for this hands-on lab. The [JupyterLab Interface](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/interface.html) is a dashboard that provides access to interactive iPython notebooks, as well as the folder structure of our environment and a terminal window into the Ubuntu operating system. The view includes a **menu bar** at the top, a **file browser** in the **left sidebar**, and a **main work area** initially open to the \"Launcher\" page.\n",

    "- You can navigate the file browser just like any other file explorer. A double click on any of the items will open a new tab with its content.\n",
    "- The main work area includes tabbed views of open files that can be closed, moved, and edited as needed.\n",
    "- The notebooks, including this one, contain a series of content and code **cells**. To execute code in a code cell, press `Shift+Enter` or the \"Run\" button in the menu bar above while highlighting a cell. Sometimes, a content cell will get switched to editing mode, in which case you can press `Shift+Enter` to change it back to a readable form.\n",
