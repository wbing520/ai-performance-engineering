    "Welcome back to the notebooks! In this course, we will be heavily focusing on the speed of an LLM to produce a response from the user's perspective. The process of measuring this speed is called **benchmarking**, which you will get the chance to do in the subsequent notebooks using a tool called [**GenAI-Perf**](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/client/tree/main/src/c%2B%2B/perf_analyzer/genai-perf). To get started, a set of pre-collected benchmarks is provided in [**dataset/nim.csv**](dataset/nim.csv) for you to explore throughout this notebook!\n",

    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will be able to:\n",
    "- Explore the real measurements of the time to first token (TTFT), end-to-end latency (E2E Latency), and inter-token latency (ITL).\n",
    "- Analyze throughput metrics and their dependencies on various factors.\n",
    "- Investigate the effects of tensor parallelism and concurrency settings on latency and throughput.\n",
    "- Utilize provided benchmarking data to make informed decisions about model deployment and scaling.\n",

For the details refer to the Â [**GenAI-Perf documentation on metrics**](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/triton-inference-server/user-guide/docs/client/src/c%2B%2B/perf_analyzer/genai-perf/README.html#metrics) and [**its source code**](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/client/blob/db888f1aca588a10f5e4a4b02a4e4ff60d437b6f/src/c%2B%2B/perf_analyzer/genai-perf/genai_perf/profile_data_parser/llm_profile_data_parser.py#L76).\n",

    "### Use-Case Definition Columns\n",
    "* `'task_inputs-model'`, `'model'`: The LLM being tested.\n",
    "* `'task_inputs-execution_type'`, `'execution_mode'`: We will be testing only `NIM_TRT-LLM`.\n",
    "* `'task_inputs-precision'`, `'precision'`: In our case, `FP16` or `FP8`. Due to the HW acceleration supported in Hopper architecture, one may significantly benefit from reducing the precision, while keeping the accuracy close to the original.\n",
    "* `'input_config-synthetic_input_tokens_mean'`, `input_len`: We are using a synthetic dataset generator, built into GenAI-Perf. This is the target mean of the distribution of the LLM inputs in tokens.\n",
    "* `'input_config-synthetic_input_tokens_stddev'`: This is the target standard deviation of the input lengths in tokens.\n",
    "* `'input_config-output_tokens_mean'`, `output_len`: For benchmarking, we force the LLM to generate a specific number of tokens and ignore End Of Sequence (EOS) tokens. This is a simple trick to simulate the responses, similar in length to the real ones, even without using a real data subsample. Real datasets are also supported by GenAI-Perf.\n",
    "* `'task_inputs-n_gpus'`, `n_gpus`: Number of GPUs. In our case, the model is parallelized across GPUs using tensor parallelism only (TP). See [the *Tensor Parallelism* section](#Tensor-Parallelism) for details.\n",
    "* `'task_inputs-GPU'`, `'device'`: The type of the GPU the benchmark has been using. In our case, the benchmark has been run on a DGX A100 with `A100-SXM4-80GB` and on a DGX H100 with `H100_80GB_HBM3`.\n",
    "* `'input_config-concurrency'`, `'concurrency'`: Concurrency. With `concurrency=N`, GenAI-Perf attempts to send inference requests to the server such that N requests are always outstanding during profiling. For example, when using 4, GenAI-Perf will attempt to have 4 outgoing inference requests at all times during profiling. At the start of benchmarking, it immediately sends 4 requests and then, as soon as any request is completed, it sends a new one."

As for many following columns, the unit is specified in a separate column: `'time_to_first_token-unit'`. In our case, this is `ns`, nanoseconds, $10^{-9}$ s, but to simplify understanding we convert `'latency_first_token'` to ms, milliseconds, $10^{-3}$ s. Some additional percentiles of the same distribution are also measured. In our dataset, we see the 95th percentile p95 in `'time_to_first_token-p95'`. `min` and `max` are also measured, but are not present in our dataset.\n",

    "* `'request_throughput-avg'`, `'prompts_per_s'`: Number of final responses from benchmark divided by benchmark duration.\n",
    "* `'output_token_throughput-avg'`, `'out_tokens_per_s'`: Total number of output tokens from benchmark divided by benchmark duration\n",
    "* `'num_output_token-avg'`: Average total number of output tokens of a request, one value per request in the benchmark. Note, that these are counted with a default tokenizer. It allows comparing models between each other, but the exact token count may be skewed due to the specifics of the tokenizers used in the models.\n",

    "## **Sizing Best Practices**\n",
    "To effectively estimate sizing for your project, the following best practices have been identified:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### NVIDIA Software Stack\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use the NVIDIA software stack, including: [NIM](https://docs.nvidia.com/nim/large-language-models/latest/getting-started.html), [TensorRT-LLM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/tree/main) and [Triton Inference Server](https://github.com/triton-inference-server).\n",
    "* Utilize [GenAI-Perf](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/triton-inference-server/user-guide/docs/client/src/c%2B%2B/perf_analyzer/genai-perf/README.html) and [the NIM benchmarking guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/nim/benchmarking/llm/latest/metrics.html) to measure the performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model Size and Hardware Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "* For models larger than 13B that require more than one GPU, prefer NVLink-enabled systems.\n",
    "* Larger models require more memory and have higher latency, scaling approximately with the model size.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Streaming vs. Sequential Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "* Apps where the LLM response is consumed directly should be developed in streaming mode.\n",
    "* Apps where the LLM response is consumed by another LLM or sequential system require sequential mode.\n",
    "* When designing apps from scratch, develop them to rely on streaming mode. For older apps, sequential mode may be used as a workaround to introduce LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Other Performance Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "* The cost and latency are usually dominated by the number of output tokens, as indicated by `ttft_ratio`. Input tokens are much cheaper.\n",
    "* TTFT is determined by the input length in streaming mode.\n",
    "* Generating text is almost always faster than human reading speed.\n",
    "* Introducing strict latency limits can significantly decrease available throughput."
